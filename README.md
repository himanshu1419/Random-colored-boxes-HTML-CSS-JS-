# Random-colored-boxes-HTML-CSS-JS
In this mini project I have used HTML,CSS,Javascript to generate random colored boxes.

HTML:

The HTML creates a container that holds multiple boxes. Each box is represented by a div element.
A button labeled "Reset Color" is added below the boxes to trigger the random color generation.

CSS:

CSS is used to style the boxes, giving them a fixed width, height, and layout.
Additional styles ensure that the boxes are evenly spaced and visually appealing.


JavaScript:

A script generates random colors for each box whenever the "Reset Color" button is clicked.
A function creates random  color values and assigns them to the background of each box.
The reset button is wired to trigger the color-changing function every time it's clicked.
